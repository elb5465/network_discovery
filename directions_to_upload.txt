##### get tools to compile it with
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheelpython3 -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel

##### compile it i think with this
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel

##### get latest version of twine (tool to upload to test.pypi.org)
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade twine

##### do the actual upload (first-time)
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*

##### do the uploads afterwards to update it (change version in setup.py)
##### run the 'python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel' command again
#####then do...
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/* --skip-existing

##### to download the most recent version, use:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ network-discovery==<INSERT_VERSION>

##### so if I want to download the fourth version, i would use:
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ network-discovery==0.0.4
